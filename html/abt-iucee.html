<h1>About IUCEE</h1>

<p align="justify">
The Indo US Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE), with headquarters at University of Massachusetts Lowell, was conceptualized by over 150 leaders of engineering education and businesses from US and India in 2007. Generous financial contributions from distinguished patrons have helped initiate the program. The vision of IUCEE is to improve the quality and global relevance of engineering education and research in India and related benefits to US engineering educators, with focus on faculty development, student development, curriculum development, as well as improved teaching technologies &amp; research.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The IUCEE process is already under way during the past five years. Each year, international experts from the US travel to India to discuss global best practices in teaching and research in their field with Indian faculty at <b>Faculty Leadership Institutes (FLI)</b>. During the past five years, 170 workshops were conducted. Significant positive outcomes from these FLIs have been demonstrated. Networks for collaborations have been created between faculty from over 150 Indian colleges and 250 US faculty members from over 50 US institutions resulting in a wide variety of research and teaching collaborations.</p>

<p align="justify">
The <b>IUCEE College Consortium</b>, created in 2010, has 71 members as of May 2014. Members receive special assistance in establishing collaborations with US experts and institutions. It also enables IUCEE to become financially sustainable. The <b>IUCEE Virtual Academy</b> has been created in 2011, using technology to enable US experts to conduct live Webinars and MiniCourses on-line from the US to faculty and students all over India. More than 250 one-hour webinars on teaching, research and general education topics have been conducted online by US faculty to Indian faculty and students. In addition, 26 MiniCourses of 10 Webinar Lectures each by US experts have been conduted during 2012-13. Links to recordings of all the webinars and lectures are available in on our own blog site <a href="http://iucee.com/" target="new">http://iucee.com/</a> as well as our partner Lensoo platform (<a href="http://www.lensoo.com/" target="new">http://www.lensoo.com/</a>). The IUCEE Research Academy has been launched in 2013 with the goal of providing mentoring and co-guides for faculty in Indian colleges who are pursuing PhD. Two Research Academy workshops have been successfully conducted. Distinguished US faculty researchers participated and were available for mentoring the Indian faculty.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The <b>IUCEE-GEDC</b> (Global Engineering Deans Council) has been formally launched and now has 28 members. 16 members attended the Global Engineering Deans Conference in Chicago in October 2013. The <b>IUCEE-SPEED</b> (Student Platform for Engineering Education Development) has been launched. Several leadership workshops for students have been conducted all over India. Representatives participated in the Global Student Forum at in Columbia in September 2013.The Indian Student Forum ISF 2014 was held at Hubli on Jan 14 and 15, 2014. The <b>India Chapter of ASEE </b>has been formed with 25 individual members from IUCEE Colleges. This will enable a platform for IUCEE to actively participate in the Annual Conferences of ASEE starting with the 2014 Annual ASEE Conference in Indianapolis in June 2014. <b>IUCEE and IGIP</b> are proposing to initiate Teacher Certification in India with accreditation by IGIP (International Society for Engineering Education), Austria.
</p>

<p align="justify">
IUCEE has co-organized a very successful First Annual Conference on Transformations in Engineering Education <b>(ICTIEE 2014)</b> at Hubli, India with over 400 participants. <b>ICTIEE 2015</b> is under planning to he hosted in Bangalore. IUCEE is co-editing a new Journal of Engineering Education Transformations <b>(JEET)</b> as a forum for publication of scholarly research and programs in engineering education. IUCEE has started exploring possibilities of Twinning and Joint Degree programs as well as Study Abroad programs between US colleges and IUCEE Colleges in India.
