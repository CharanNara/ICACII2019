There is an urgent need of skilled engineers, as of now this need is not fulfilled by our engineering educational programs. Because there is a large gap between the educational structure and the societal demands, this has to be bridged by restructuring the engineering education. With this paper we come up with an approach of restructuring the engineering educational programs curriculum that bridge the gap and steer up the skills in the engineering students. An engineer should be basically a problem solver, who should own the capability to analyze and evaluate the problems arise in the society, at present we are in dire need of such engineers for the societal up gradation. In this paper, our view of initial attempt to restructure the curriculum of engineering education based on traditional age old learning will be shared. We evaluate student learning outcomes based on the practical assignment assessment results and their success in the implementation. With minor modifications in the present system and including the best of traditional year wise learning approach in engineering education can bring a radical change, create greater impact on students to make them industry ready and problem solvers of society.  <i>Keywords: </i>Technological competitiveness, Skilled engineers, Problem solvers, Restructuring curriculum, Societal demands. ^^Srinivas Aluvala 1  and Soumya Pothupogu 2     1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SR Engineering College, Warangal, India.  2 Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, SR Engineering College, Warangal, India.

s[i++]="An Integrated Technical Communication Program^069.xml^Divya Nalla and Uma Garimella^An Integrated Technical Communication Program The Graduate Attributes defined for Outcome based Education (OBE) require a graduate student to learn the prescribed curriculum through active participation, explore the vast content and get oneself updated with the current technologies in addition to the prescribed curriculum. The state government has introduced various schemes enabling wider access to engineering education. The variety includes students from various socio economic backgrounds, students who have studied in vernacular language media, students who are not proficient in English, students who are interested but lack the required mathematical skills and aptitude, students who are uninterested but have been forced by their families, and students who do not think language is an important tool they need for learning. This diversity makes OBE a challenging task. Defining course outcomes, and mapping them to the Graduate Attributes as defined in the accreditation criteria can be done with some efforts by the teachers. But achievement of these outcomes is dependent equally on the learners skills and attitude. One of the most important factors is the language as this helps the learners in better understanding of the subject and improves their access to good books, e-learning material and online resources. This paper presents specifically the need for a language development program for undergraduate engineering students to enable OBE. Finishing Schools and English language training are only coaching students to face the interviews, but English must be taught as a vehicle for learning the depth in the discipline. We studied the development of English for Specific Purposes (ESP), English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and similar work in other non-English speaking countries to devise an Integrated Technical Communication program to build English competency and meet the Graduate Attributes.

s[i++]="A Competency Based Maturity Model for OBE^072.xml^Uma Garimella  ^A Competency Based Maturity Model for OBE The Indian education system is seeing radical changes in the last one decade. Both at K-12 and higher education levels, there is a shift to learning outcomes from content, to thinking from memory based learning and to self directed learning from coercive learning. Our attitudes and systems are still stuck in the old school of thought. In this transition phase, we are facing a challenge of creating outcomes using a set of systems and people where qualifications and exam scores take precedence over competencies. Until such time that those scores and qualifications are an accurate measure of competencies, we need to create a competency based perspective on the existing people. Taking a cue from the People CMM, this paper proposes to use capability maturity perspective for colleges. Based on extensive training experience and on research in learning science elsewhere, a list of teacher and student competencies and key areas is arrived at. The five levels of maturity for students and teachers are also enumerated in each of these key competence areas. This model helps to look at the accreditation process and OBE as a continuum. It gives us a tool to assess peoples capabilities in an objective way and enables us to prepare them for the tasks. The model is at an initial stage and there are several questions to be answered before we can deploy this on a pilot basis. This is work-in-progress for a model for teacher-student interactions. If we can predict learning outcomes for specific pairs of competencies, accurate interventions can be designed for either teacher or student or both.  <i>Keywords: </i>Outcome-based education, Teacher competencies, Student comptencies, Maturity model. ^^Uma Garimella   Teachers Academy, Hyderabad, India.

Employability skills of yesteryears are not sufficient for today’s newly graduated engineers. Technical knowledge, skills and abilities, alone, even at the topmost level, possessed by a fresh engineer, are not adequate enough to face the present labour market challenges. S/he is expected to have a combination of personal qualities, resource management skills, interpersonal skills and other attributes. S/he must be capable of deploying these skills as per the situational requirements and must also improve and hone these skills, qualitatively and quantitatively. The behavioural competencies should display these, as one climbs the career ladder. India, as per the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) statistics, has 3384 engineering institutions and 1634596 student intake as of academic year 2013-2014 [1]. While we have a few good quality institutions and outcomes, reports from various corners reveal the deplorable quality of a substantial number of engineering institutions, with inferior outputs and outcomes. While many students have the potentials to develop, due to various factors, their employability skills seem to remain under-nourished and under-developed.The word engineering means practical application of science to commerce or industry. It can also be described as the discipline dealing with the art or science of applying scientific knowledge to practical problems. From an engineering students level, employability skills are the abilities, attitudes, skills and competencies one acquires through continuous efforts, from within and outside the campus, so as to equip him/her for an appropriate entry level position, that matches his/her qualification and aptitude . Institutions, policy makers and of all, the students themselves have to make sincere and effective efforts to make this happen. This paper presents a few of these skills-set expected by the employers from fresh engineering students. It further gives a brief account of the engineering student perceptions – their strong areas and weak areas within this skills-set. Before we learn the students assessments, let us have a broad understanding of the academic expectations from an engineering student."

With the help of software the teacher observes the progress of students and knows which part of the topic is not understood by the students and plans accordingly to discuss the same in class.<br />In the classroom teacher conducts group discussions, role plays, assignments, innovative challenges in order to develop higher order thinking skills.

Traditionally laboratory component provides hands on experience to conduct experiment, immobilize enzyme and assay the enzyme samples. However the conventional pedagogy practiced till date, was unable to meet the metric goal set for certain program outcomes (PO). The lack in design of term-works at various levels, improper evaluation criteria and lack of rubrics could be the most contributing factors for poor attainment of PO.<br />To address this issue, we categorized the laboratory term works into four categories: demonstration, exercise, structured enquiry and open ended experiment. Term works were carefully designed to address major technical POs and some of professional POs. Evaluation criteria for each term work are mapped to Program outcome (PO), Outcome Element (OE) and Performance Indicator (PI). This helps us in assessing the attainment of POs more precisely. The students were expected to carry-out literature review and design the experiment, with due consideration to resources &amp; feasibility. They carry out experiments, analyze and interpret the solution. The assessment of PO attainment through continuous internal evaluation reveals significant improvement in the achievement of program outcomes.

Time domain signals are simpler to analyse as most of the real time signals are in time domain. This makes it easier to visualize the signals. Moreover time domain signals can be viewed through a CRO. But the frequency domain signals look abstract. It is difficult to conceptualise the frequency components in a signal.

Programme outcomes a, b, c, d &#38; e are usually achieved through regular theory and laboratory courses. Similarly outcomes f, g, i &#38; k are achieved through mini projects, course projects and capstone projects, sometimes even through final year one credit course seminar. The measurement of remaining outcomes i.e. h and j demands additional effort from the faculty member to design special activities. Accordingly there is a lot of scope to measure outcomes h and j through conducting course seminars on many technical topics, which are related to &#8220;impact of engineering solutions&#8221; and &#8220;contemporary issues&#8221;. Hence an attempt was made to measure the impact of engineering solutions, i.e. po-h by conducting course seminar in the subject Mechatronics for V SEM students of Industrial and Production Engineering department during the year 2012-13 and 2013-14. The students worked and presented their work in the form of course seminar in teams. The evaluation of seminar was rubrics based. The seminar prepared by the students benefited them in many ways. The conduct of course seminar activity has led a platform and a basis for the students for many activities like selection of mini-projects, confidently delivering department&#8217;s pre final year and final year seminar presentation, preparing technical reports, technical papers etc. The overall process of conducting course seminar helped not only students but also the faculty in many ways.

Enquiry based learning approaches enhance students learning as compared to the conventional method. In enquiry based approach all the experiments are classified into four categories such as demonstration, exercise, structured enquiry and open ended experiment. During the year 2012-13 and 2013-14 batches, students are compared with respect to their exam score, understanding of concepts, analyzing and implementing the studied concepts, database design and the nature of problem statement given in the laboratory.<br />All the batches are given with different set of unique problem statements to avoid plagiarism and that really encouraged the students to study DBMS subject in depth, and also stimulated them to choose data mining and information retrieval subject, data engineering theme to build the capstone projects in their higher semesters. This enquiry-based laboratory conduction has enhanced the students learning skills, stimulated to acquire content knowledge, problem solving skills, asking questions, and coming up with alternate design approaches for given problem. The results of this two years study give us a clear differentiation that inquiry based approach is better for students to acquire in depth knowledge and problem solving skills as compared to traditional approach where there was no categorization of lab experiments.  <i>Keywords: </i>Program outcomes, Program educational objectives, Structured enquiry, Open ended experiments. ^^Praveen M.

Jayarekha^Academia-Industry Collaboration to Improve the Quality of Teaching-Learning Process In traditional output-based education system, class room lecture and laboratory are the traditional delivery methods used during the course. Written examination and lab examination have been used as a conventional tool for evaluating students performance. Hence there are certain apprehensions that the traditional education system may not efficiently prepare the students for competent professional life. This has led for the change from Traditional output-based education to Outcome-Based Education (OBE). OBE first sets the ideal programme learning outcome consecutively on increasing degree of complexity that students are expected to master. The core curriculum, teaching methodologies and assessment tools are then designed to achieve the proposed outcomes mainly focusing on what students can actually attain after they are taught. In this paper we discuss a promising applications based learning and evaluation component involving industry collaboration to improve the quality of teaching and student learning process. Incorporation of this component definitely improves the quality of student learning in engineering education and helps the student to attain the competency as per the graduate attributes. This may also reduce the Industry-academia gap.  <i>Keywords: </i>Outcome-Based education, Programme learning outcome, Teaching-learning process, Evaluation, Industry collaboration. ^^M.

But industry leaders constantly complain about the absence of quality engineers for their industries. The future success of Indian industry depends on the growth of quality engineering education (EE) in India, especially since Indian industry is competing globally in software, and in areas such as automobiles, chemicals and engineering equipment. In India, majority of students opt for engineering after their 12th standard. A very high percentage of this majority opt for engineering succumbing to peer pressure without any prior knowledge on the profession and discipline. This results in freshmen students unable to cope with the curriculum from the very first year of study. This keeps piling up till their final year which results in lack of quality engineers graduating from colleges. Making efforts to address this crisis at the beginning would be the right time and would stop the problem from escalating. This paper discusses an initiative which was designed to address this issue for freshmen students.  <i>Keywords: </i>Induction program, Engineering education. ^^Rohit Kandakatla a  and Soujanya Reddy b    KG Reddy College of Engineering and Technology, Hyderabad, India.

It is a need of present era to have soft skills, to be employable for engineers. However, when we are in a hurry to train final year engineering students for soft skills, we need to first scrutinize what are their requirements and their aptitude to cope with the training being imparted. On one hand where we are providing best of the resources to enhance soft skills, on the other hand there is a major disconnect from the students side. The results will be devastating, which, we will come to know at very advanced stage, where system is helpless. Hence while designing course for Soft Skills we need to give major consideration to andragogy, cooperative learning, specific most wanted soft skills and most of all students take off level, as far as we are considering engineering students. In present paper failure of certain training methods and successful results post re-design will be discussed.

Kumbhar^Project Based Learning: An Integrated Aproach for Outcome Based Learning Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a student-driven, teacher-facilitated approach to learning. It is a key strategy for creating independent thinkers and learners. Learning responsibility, independence, and discipline are three outcomes of PBL. In traditional engineering education, projects are given to UG and PG students as a separate course. For inculcating the skills required in 21 st  century, this seems to be in-sufficient. The PBL approach is suggested for subjects like Value Engineering, an open elective (student of any discipline can opt for), for better learning. The value engineering course is useful for various engineering programs, hence it is treated as multi-displinary subject. In this paper, authors have implemented the course at post graduate level and summarized the outcomes. The outcomes gained from this exercise is encouraging one. This paper provides foundation for changing education approaches from a traditional lecture-based format to advanced project-based format. An outline for a project-based learning course is presented with experiences and lessons learned from four implementations of the course.

The engineering programme offered through regular classroom mode at the university departments, affiliating colleges in India go behind different curriculum and syllabi time to time. Even the curriculum and syllabi of the same programme offered in any one university through different modes are even different. E-learning is a global element which requires uniformity. Problem based approach such as David Merrills First Principles of instruction is the best approach for curriculum and syllabi development and designing the learning content. The e-content shall be created as module-based sharable learning objects in alignment with the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) standard such that they could be used for different courses of different programme or for the programme of same discipline that could be offered as a problem-based learning. Hence the module/object/problem reusability would be accomplished that will certainly save and minimize the effort, time and cost of creating e-learning content. If such knowledge objects are created and deployed at the web server once then that could be well used for e-learning modules through Learning Grid (Data Grid technology) created for that purpose.

Therefore, the attainment process might end up with either measuring too many things making the entire exercise very hectic or measuring too little that may not be sufficient to capture the intent of the outcome. Nowadays the practice is to expand each of the program outcomes into a set of outcome elements. As a result, the faculty members can use these elements in adapting the outcomes to their courses. Even with the elements being known, many a times it is a difficult proposition especially for the novice and in-experienced faculty members to plan their delivery and assessment mechanism. The reason being each element may involve several attributes or stages before it is fully understood.

The primary reason cited for this mismatch is that of the lack of technical aptitude in the graduates who are embarking on the technical journey leaving the portals of the graduating institution. On one side of the scale, we have the ever-changing demands of the industry driven by the innovation and global competitiveness, the other end of the scale, we are stuck with curricula which emphasizes deeply on theoretical expertise.

Assessment Tool is a concept to be used as against the mundane assessment method. This paper gives an experience report of the first author in implementation of two important courses taken by the students of department of Medical Electronics in two different semesters. The courses under consideration are with no laboratory attachment and so the students fall short of experiencing the outcomes for different concepts of the subject. An assessment tool was therefore introduced in the form of usage of a software tool to implement the concepts learnt in theory. The novel assessment tool usage introduced was assessed to quantify the effect of practical exposure. The improvement thus seen had a normal distribution in the scores obtained by students and looked ideal for the range of student group which usually had a skewed pattern.  <i>Keywords: </i>Assessment tool, Biostatistics, Control systems, Teaching beyond syllabus. ^^Appaji M.

Suresh Kumar and Flory Francis^Innovativeness in Teaching Internal Combustion Engines Using Alternate Assessment Tool The teaching learning process in educational institutions around the globe is seeing a paradigm shift in that the centre point is shifted from what the teacher is able to deliver to what the student is able to deliver after completion of his graduation. The present days mantra in educational institutions is the Outcome Based Education (OBE). In the process of inculcating the qualities in the students which help them in achieving the required outcomes as expected by the OBE system, there needs to be an innovative approach in the curriculum development as well as in the content delivery methods. In this direction, an attempt has been made in delivering the subject I.C. (Internal Combustion) Engines to the Mechanical Engineering Students of BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.<br />In the modern society where the speed of delivery is of utmost importance, transportation takes the centre stage. I.C. Engines has always been the heart of the transport system. Hence learning IC engines has become a necessity for placements, higher education and research.<br />Innovativeness is brought about by the usage of Alternate Assessment Tool in delivering the contents of the subject.  <i>Keywords: </i>OBE, Alternate assessment tool, IC engines. ^^^^R.

Message  Give an individual professional education and you have given him a lifestyle. It was the belief of well-known visionary leader, philanthropist, physician, educationist, banker and founder of Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG), Padma Shri Dr. TMA Pai.  In my opinion quality engineering and professional education is one of the most important tool to improve the society and drive growth. In the fast changing times where knowledge is exploding at a rapid pace the education also needs to change and transform to remain more meaningful. I believe the concept of learning, unlearning and re-learning would be one of the most important to remain relevant in any engineering profession including the engineering education. The learning also needs better and stronger in terms of components of experiential learning through dealing with real life situations, case studies, industry exposures, societal problem solving and greater emphasis on applications of technology etc.  I strongly feel that the future engineering education (for that matter any other specialisation) would be linked to the concept of anytime, anywhere, any mode and any combination teaching-learning ultimately paving way for greater self-learning. Inclusion of online and technology enabled learning, even in the cases of laboratory experimentation, would bring more heterogeneity and interest amongst learners. The whole effort and change would lead to satisfying an individuals quest for knowledge rather than for sake of degree or employment.  I am confident that IUCEE being uniquely positioned will be one of the major leaders in enabling the changes envisaged above. Undoubtedly, ICTIEE-2015 would prove to be an important milestone in this journey of transforming the engineering education.
