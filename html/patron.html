<p align="justify">Greetings from B.M.S College of Engineering.</p>
<p align="justify">Transformation is essential for a progressing world be it social or technical. It is like a seed - an idea that
sparks phenomenal discoveries shaping mankind. Engineering education drives us to explore new frontiers
in Science and Technology. Education should focus on changes that would bring paradigm shift in constructive
learning yielding sustainable growth for better tomorrow. This International Conference on Transformation
in Engineering Education provides an excellent platform for initiating collaborative research projects leading to
great innovation. It is our privilege and honour to host an event of such magnitude having a scholarly gathering
of eminent personalities from academia and corporate world. It is heartwarming to note that a good number of
papers have been received from all corners of the world. I hope the Conference will enlighten the recent trends
in engineering education and will ignite the spirit of science. On behalf of B.M.S Educational Trust, I welcome
the wonderful participants and wish the Conference a grand success.</p>

<p align="justify">It is my privilege and honor to welcome the delegates of International Conference on Transformation in Engineering Education (ICTIEE-2015). </p>
<p align="justify">The ICTIEE-2015 provides a forum for some of the best academicians and industry experts from across the world to discuss and exchange the best approaches in transforming engineering education in India and make our graduates competent to face huge global market. The Management of BMSCE is making persistent efforts to translate the cherished desire of our beloved founders of producing top globally relevant top quality engineering graduates.</p>
<p align="justify">I believe this conference will prove to be of immense value in bringing out the best of thoughts and ideas that pave way for engineering educational reforms with specific reference to preparing our engineering graduates for global market and challenges it offers.</p>
<p align="justify">I would like to thank all the delegates for accepting our invitation to participate in this conference and I wish you all a very pleasant stay. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the organizing committee and all those associated with the event, for their planning and their efforts in making the conference a grand success. </p>

<p align="justify">I am very pleased to extend this message to the Second International conference on &#8220;<i>Transformations in Engineering Education</i>&#8221;, Organized by IUCEE &amp; BMSCE, Bangalore.</p>
<p align="justify">India produces large amount of engineering graduates in the world after china. It is challenging to nurture quality engineers who are recognized an accepted by the academic community and corporates globally. BMSCE&#8217;s proactive and pioneer initiatives have allowed greater flexibility and increased mobility to the degrees offered by the college, and to its graduates an option for higher studies and better jobs in member countries of the Washington Accord. The undergraduate degrees by BMS College of Engineering are now acceptable in the nations that have conformed to the Washington Accord. Credit Transfer onmutual consent basis with other Tier-I accredited collegeswill increase trams-national opportunities to BMSCE students, and facilitate hassle-free admissions, sans donations, in other Tier-I Universities in over 20 other countries e.g. The UK, the USA, Australia, Canada, Taiwan, South Africa and New Zealand.</p>
<p align="justify">The outcome based education followed, helps our engineering students to face real challenges with the right kind of skills. The outcome based education become reality only when Industry &#8211; Academia partnerships are encouraged through similar platforms. This international conference will be a great initiative towards this.</p>
<p align="justify">I congratulate the organizers and participants on this achievement.</p>

<p align="justify">I am pleased to extend my warmest greetings to all those who are attending the 2nd International Conference on &#8220;<i>Transformations in Engineering Education</i>&#8221;, organized by Indo US Collaboration for Engineering Education (IUCEE) in association with BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore.</p>
<p align="justify">The chosen theme, &#8220;Transformations in Engineering Education&#8221;, is timely and relevant in the light of education. The world needs outstanding engineering talent to address the challenges facing humanity. The vision of this International Conference, to bring together leaders of engineering education from across the world, for Sharing Best Practices for preparing engineering graduates in addressing global challenges is appreciable.</p>
<p align="justify">BMSCE&#8217;s 69 years of providing superior quality in engineering education has taken another leap forward with this initiative. BMSCE has been endorsed in Tier-I category by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), recognized under the Washington Accord. Being one of the first Institutions in India, to be bestowed with this Accreditation, it is the responsibility of the Institution to facilitate transformations in Engineering education through Global Collaborations.</p>

<p align="justify">On behalf of the BMS College of Engineering, I am honoured to extend warm
greetings to everyone attending the Second International conference on
Transformations in Engineering Education on 6th January to 8 January 2015
organised by IUCEE in association with BMS College of Engineering Bangalore.</p>
<p align="justify">We are living in the age of globalisation, which is going to intensify further in
the 21st century, offering both challenges and opportunities. India is demographically
young and is aiming at realising maximum possible demographic
dividend. However to utilize the opportunities offered by globalisation and
realise the demographic-dividend, we need to create technical human resource
which is sync with the rapidly changing technological world. Engineering education has a
pivotal role to play in creating world class engineers. In this light the international conference titled
&#8220;Transformations in Engineering Education&#8221; is very relevant and timely. It&#8217;s going to shed light on all the
factors, explore different dimensions and perspectives relating to the topic.</p>
<p align="justify">Being, the only partner institution from India for the Melton foundation, BMSCE is honoured to host
an event that promotes quality education.On behalf of myself and all the BMSCE members, I send
Greetings to all the speakers and delegates for an inspiring and uplifting Conference.</p>
